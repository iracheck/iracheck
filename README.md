## About Me
Hi, I'm Ira, and I enjoy building interesting projects to learn more about Software Engineering. See them below and feel free to make modifications yourself. Specifically with my AI Simulation, they all change so often as I try to teach myself new things.

**Currently working on**: revamping the AI in my AI simulation using a more dynamic State machine

## My Projects  
#### Software Engineering
- **[PCRemote](https://github.com/iracheck/pcremote-csharp)** - A desktop utility for Windows 11 built in C#/.NET that enables precise mouse and keyboard input simulation using a game controller. Ideal for desktop use, non-native game integration, and accessibility. **March 2025**, but currently working on a V2 with GUI.
#### Modding
- **[Dynamic Squad AI Simulation](https://github.com/iracheck/DynamicSimulationMod)** (marketed as "GangWarSandbox") - Developed an extensible combat simulation framework with abstract gamemode API, lifecycle hooks, custom faction/vehicle configs via .ini. Over 200 downloads as of 1/26. **May 2025-August 2025**, **January 2026**
#### School Projects
- **[Networking Project (Chat App)](https://github.com/iracheck/chatapp-group4 )** - Collaborated with a team of four other classmates to build a chat app with a C backend and Java frontend. I specifically worked on the C backend, ensuring it was stable and didnt use too many resources. **April 2025-May 2025**
